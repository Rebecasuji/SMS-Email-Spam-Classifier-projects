Project Title:
SMS/Email Spam Classifier
Description:
This project aims to classify text messages (SMS) and emails as either "spam" or "not spam" using machine learning techniques. It leverages natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the content of messages and determine their nature based on trained models.

Features:
Text classification using machine learning models.
Support for both SMS and email formats.
High accuracy in distinguishing spam from legitimate messages.
Easy integration into messaging platforms and email servers.
Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spam-classifier.git
cd spam-classifier
Install dependencies: Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the required packages using pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NLTK
Usage
To classify messages, use the classify.py script. This script takes a message as input and outputs whether it's classified as spam or not.

python classify.py --message "Your message here"
Training the Model
To train the model on new data, follow these steps:

Prepare your dataset in CSV format with columns labeled Message and Label, where Label is either "spam" or "not spam".
Run the training script:
python train.py --dataset path/to/your/dataset.csv
This will update the model with the new training data.
